[Term]
id: HTTP
comment: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is part of the Internet protocol suite, allows access to pages from Web servers. HTTP is an application layer protocol according to the OSI reference model.

[Term]
id: IP
comment: IP (Internet Protocol) is a protocol for transmitting data over the Internet. The data is retrieved and divided into datagrams (IP packets) by the transport layer, transmitted over the Internet, and then reassembled by the network layer.

[Term]
id: ISO_stack
comment: ISO stack - protocols stack developed by the International Organization of Standardization (ISO). Each layer of the ISO model has certain protocols and functions. The ISO protocols stack works from the hardware physical layer to the software application layer.

[Term]
id: LoWPAN
comment: The LoWPAN protocol belongs to the Internet layer and is extended from IP. It works on Low Power and Wireless Personal Area Network i.e., LoWPAN, and comprises an edge router and sensor nodes.

[Term]
id: MQTT
comment: MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is a standard IoT protocol that transfers data provided by sensors and performs communications via satellite.

[Term]
id: NFC_tag
comment: NFC tags (Near Field Communication limited to high-frequency) are protocols that identify passive things. NFC tags are passive, meaning they don't have any power source. They take power from the device that reads them, through magnetic induction.

[Term]
id: Optical_tag
comment: Identifying passive things can be performed using protocols such as optical tags, as hardware transmitters to nearby portable electronic devices.

[Term]
id: PAN
comment: PAN (Personal Area Network) is a network protocol that ensures the connection between devices within a radius of 10 meters. A PAN usually involves a PC, phone, personal digital assistant, tablet, printer, speakers, video game consoles, etc.

[Term]
id: RFID_tag
comment: RFID tags (Radio Frequency Identification) are used as hardware transmitters to nearby portable electronic devices, for identifying passive things.

[Term]
id: SAMPL
comment: SAMPL is a compact network layer that operates on top of a low-power CSMA/CA-based MAC protocol. SAMPL operates as part of the sensor Andrew project at Carnegie Mellon University and FireFly wireless sensor networks.

[Term]
id: TCP
comment: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) corresponds to the Transport layer of the Internet protocol suite TCP/IP. Common applications using TCP are the World Wide Web (WWW), e-mail, and file transfer (FTP).

[Term]
id: UDP
comment: UDP (User Datagram Protocol) corresponds to the Transport layer of the Internet protocol suite TCP/IP. UDP ensures the delivery of messages over a network, but unlike the TCP protocol, information packets are generally sent without receipt confirmation.

[Term]
id: WPAN
comment: WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network) is a PAN that ensures the connection between devices through wireless, within a radius of 10 meters. WPAN includes wearable devices, USB flash drives, wireless mouse, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, thermostats, security systems, lighting controls, motion sensors, etc.

[Term]
id: XMPP
comment: XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open standard that offers support for middleware applications, invisible messaging with the TCP network layer (hides the details of messaging), voice and video calls, collaboration, and generalized routing of XML data.
